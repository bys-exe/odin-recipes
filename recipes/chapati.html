        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This chapati recipe is simple and delicious. Serve this Indian bread with curries or use it as a sandwich wrap.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup hot water or as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into <em>10 equal portions</em>, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat. Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin.</li>
            <li>When the skillet starts to <em>smoke</em>, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about <em>30 seconds</em>, then flip and cook <em>30 seconds more</em>.</li>
            <li>Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
        </ol>
